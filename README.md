# Whisper2

**Work in progess**<br>
Small and simple Windows desktop chat client for large language models written in Rust and Svelte.
Only Ollama is currently supported, with OpenAI and RAG support in planning.

> [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) needs to be installed on your system!

Whisper2 will start Ollama at startup if it is not already running but will communicate with an already running
Ollama instance if their is one.
